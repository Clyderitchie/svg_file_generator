# svg_file_generator

## Description
    This application allows a user to answer a few questions from within the terminal to generate a SVG file for a logo. The user will be prompted to answer what text they would like within their logo, must be no more then 3 characters or it will prompted them to enter again until it is 3 or less characters, what color they would like their shape to be, what shape they would like to have, there is 3 different style of shapes triangles, squares, and circles, and finally the user will be asked what color they would like text to be. Once the user answers the questions a new file that is named after the shape and its color will generate within the examples folder.

## Usage
   User will have to start the program and answer the questions that are asked within the terminal to get a SVG file to generate.

## Start
    npm start

## Test
    npm run test
    The test is preformed by jest, which was installed using npm i jest, and has the --watch on to update the test as the file is worked on. The test checks two things for each shape. The first test will test if the shape will be an instance of either a circle, square, or triangle. For the second test it tests for the styling of the shapes by comparing what styling the user could use and comparing it to a example in the tests folder.
